#Introduction

Portfolio created Fall 2021***

Your portfolio should demonstrate each of the following skills (not all of which are demonstrated in this example):

* Displaying multiple vector layers on the same map - New York Public Spaces 
* Calculating and displaying relationships among point and polygon layers based on distance - Chicago schools dist to CBD
* Aggregating point data to a layer of polygons - Chicago schools in comm areas
* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time -Isochrones and TT Analysis
* Converting between raster layers and vector layers - SLC?
* Displaying raster data on a map - SLC accessibility
* Georeferencing a raster image - East Boston
* Displaying data on an interactive map - Monterey

## Accessibility
This map shows accessibility based on a distance-decay function of the walking time to the nearest transit stop. It demonstrates the following skills:

* Calculating and displaying accessibility, based on travel time
* Displaying raster data on a map
* Converting between raster layers and vector layers

#Monterey, California

## Interactive Map - Education Level and Schools
This interactive map demonstrates the following skills: 

* Displaying data on an interactive map
